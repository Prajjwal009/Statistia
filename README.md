A helpful app for procrastinators like me :)


So the app is basically a task manager kind of, but it is not for reminding your tasks neither to present a checklist for your tasks.
I have tried to make (kind of) new thing out of it. 
You can set your tasks for today or tomorrow and it with a certain amount of time. The app will provide 3 tags to set tasks under.
For example: Python coding tear for 180 minutes with Productivity tag.
And will provide stats of your tasks.
